description: |
  During each phase of the operation, the sequential planner loops through all agents (which are part of the
  operation's group) and sends each of them a list of all ability commands the planner thinks it can complete. This
  decision is based on the agent matching the operating system (execution platform) of the ability and the ability 
  command having no unsatisfied variables. It then waits for each agent to complete their list of commands before
  moving on to the next phase. In phaseless operations, all applicable commands are executed in a single phase which
  will then run to completion and finish the operation.
