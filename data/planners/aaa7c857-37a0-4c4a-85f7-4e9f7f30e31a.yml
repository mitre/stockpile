description: |
  During each phase of the operation, the atomic planner iterates through each agent and sends the next
  available ability it thinks that agent can complete. This decision is based on the agent matching the operating
  system (execution platform) of the ability and the ability command having no unsatisfied variables.
  The planner then waits for each agent to complete its command before determining the subsequent abilities.
  The abilities are processed in the order set by each agent's atomic ordering.
  For instance, if agent A has atomic ordering (A1, A2, A3) and agent B has atomic ordering (B1, B2, B3), then
  the planner would send (A1, B1) in the first phase, then (A2, B2), etc.
