  name: Notepad++ DLL Hijack Persistence
  description: 'This ability exploits a vulnerability in Notepad++ v8.5.4 by downloading
    the portable version and installing a malicious UxTheme.dll in its directory.
    When launched, Notepad++ loads this rogue DLL due to Windows'' DLL search order,
    executing arbitrary code that deploys another agent. Code execution is achieved
    through a txt file containing the agent deployment command. This file is accessed
    and written into a buffer through WinAPI calls and then is executed via another
    WinAPI call.


    Cleanup Commands:


    The txt file and notepad++ zip file are then deleted
